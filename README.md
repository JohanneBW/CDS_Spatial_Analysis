## Correlation between traffic accidents and location

**Project for Spatial Analytics, Cultural Data Science 2021**

**Introduction**

This repository contains my exam projec for my Spatial Analytics class in Cultural Data Science. My project deals with the connection between traffic accidents in relation to spatially clustered data points.

**Software Framework**

The code for this project is written on my MacBook macOS, version 10.15.7. I installed the desktop version of R (4.1.0) and RStudio (1.4.1106). The project uses the following packages: tidyverse, sf, rgdal, leaflet, spatstat, maptools, sp and raster. See the Session Info chunk in the end of the script (Traffic_accidents.Rmd) for more details about the individual packages and versions. 

The data containing information about the traffic accidents, the locations and which type of accident it is, are in a mapinfo format. This means that the data contains a number of files (shp, qpj, cpg etc.), all of which must be present before the data works optimally.
